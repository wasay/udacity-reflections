When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you are working from multiple computers or multiple people are working on the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling manually will make sure that none of my local changes are overwritten with others work. 
	Also I may be not on the same branch, which can create more issues with automatic pull.
