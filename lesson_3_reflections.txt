When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you are working from multiple computers or multiple people are working on the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling manually will make sure that none of my local changes are overwritten with others work. 
	Also I may be not on the same branch, which can create more issues with automatic pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are created from GitHub only, forks are created mostly when the user may not have permissions to push changes to remote.
	Clones allow the user to clone and branch from GitHub or local command line.
	Branches lets the users work on different task at any given time and switch between branches when different priority is assigned to a different task.
	
	Forks only when on GitHub, Clones when I want to copy of a project. Branches when I want to work on a particular task or branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	The last known state will help in looking up what is changed and also help in fast forwarding the change if non conflicts are found.
