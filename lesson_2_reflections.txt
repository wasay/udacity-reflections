What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A ".git" folder is added to the directory and it will allow me to track changes into the 
	directory and will allow me to see the history of a given file.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area allows to mark a change in time, while I continue to work on a file and either 
	I can update the staging area with the updates or discard the changes in the file.
